# Lovefield

Lovefield is a relational query engine written in pure JavaScript. It also
provides help with persisting data on the browser side, e.g. using IndexedDB
to store data locally. It provides SQL-like syntax and works cross-browser
(currently supporting Chrome 37+, Firefox 31+, IE 10+, and Safari 5.1+, see note
below).
